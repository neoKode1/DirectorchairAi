# Nano Banana Edit Integration

## Overview

The `fal-ai/nano-banana/edit` model has been successfully integrated into the IntelligentChatInterface component. This model provides advanced image-to-image editing capabilities with high fidelity transformations.

## What Was Added

### 1. Model Configuration (`src/lib/fal.ts`)
- Added `fal-ai/nano-banana/edit` to the `AVAILABLE_ENDPOINTS` array
- Configured with proper input schema: `image_urls` array and `prompt`
- Set up initial parameters for image editing tasks

### 2. Intelligence Core Updates (`src/lib/intelligence-core.ts`)
- Added `'image-edit'` to the `ConversationState.imageActionType` union type
- Created `containsImageEditKeywords()` method to detect editing requests
- Updated `analyzeUserIntent()` to route image editing tasks to nano-banana/edit
- Added image editing keywords: `edit`, `modify`, `change`, `transform`, `alter`, `adjust`, `enhance`, `improve`

### 3. API Route Updates (`src/app/api/fal/image/route.ts`)
- Added support for `image_urls` parameter (required by nano-banana/edit)
- Added model-specific handling for `nano-banana/edit` endpoint
- Configured proper parameter mapping for the model

### 4. UI Component Updates (`src/components/intelligent-chat-interface.tsx`)
- Enhanced uploaded image handling to detect editing vs animation requests
- Updated placeholder text to mention "animate or edit"
- Modified upload button tooltip to indicate editing capability
- Updated helper text and badges to reflect dual functionality

## How It Works

### 1. User Uploads an Image
When a user uploads an image, the system now analyzes their prompt to determine intent:

```typescript
// Check if this is an image editing request
if (intent.type === 'image' && intent.keywords.some(keyword => 
  ['edit', 'modify', 'change', 'transform', 'alter', 'adjust', 'enhance', 'improve'].includes(keyword)
)) {
  // Route to nano-banana/edit
  delegation.modelId = 'fal-ai/nano-banana/edit';
  delegation.parameters = {
    image_urls: [uploadedImage],
    prompt: userInput.trim()
  };
}
```

### 2. Automatic Model Selection
The intelligence core automatically detects editing keywords and routes to the appropriate model:

- **Editing keywords**: `edit`, `modify`, `change`, `transform`, `alter`, `adjust`, `enhance`, `improve`
- **Animation keywords**: `animate`, `move`, `motion`, `video`, `cinematic`, `action`, `dynamic`

### 3. API Call Structure
The nano-banana/edit model expects:
```typescript
{
  prompt: "Edit this image to add a beautiful sunset background",
  image_urls: ["https://example.com/image.jpg"],
  num_images: 1,
  output_format: "jpeg"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Image Editing
1. Upload an image
2. Type: "Edit this image to add a vintage film grain effect"
3. System automatically routes to nano-banana/edit
4. Generates edited image with the requested effect

### Animation (Existing)
1. Upload an image  
2. Type: "Animate this image with smooth camera movement"
3. System routes to video generation models
4. Creates animated video

## Testing

A test file has been created at `src/tests/nano-banana-edit-test.ts` that includes:
- Basic model functionality test
- Multiple editing prompt variations
- Error handling and logging

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Integration**: Users can now edit images without changing their workflow
2. **Intelligent Routing**: System automatically detects editing vs animation intent
3. **High Fidelity**: nano-banana/edit provides superior image editing quality
4. **Consistent UI**: No additional UI changes required - uses existing upload flow

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Dedicated editing mode with specialized UI
- Batch editing capabilities
- Style presets for common editing tasks
- Before/after comparison views

## Technical Notes

- The model uses `image_urls` array instead of single `image_url`
- Supports multiple output formats (jpeg, png)
- Maintains aspect ratio and quality of original images
- Compatible with existing FAL.ai client library
